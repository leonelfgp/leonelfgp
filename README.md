I studied Information Technology and Communication Engineering at the Technological University of León, I have over 2 years working in the IT industry, 
my last job was in the UX | UI and development area at Quiubas Mobile, where I was in charge of designing web interfaces for desktop and mobile, graphic resources,
style guides, flow charts and site maps, posts for social networks and product presentations. It is worth mentioning my experience developing E-commerce websites 
for different footwear brands such as Calzado Efe, Florsheim and restaurants such as SushiTai.

I consider myself a responsible, orderly person who enjoys team work and professional growth, if you would like to collaborate feel free to send me a message or
